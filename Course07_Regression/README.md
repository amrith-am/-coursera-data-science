# Introduction
This is the seventh course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, **Regression Models**. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. 

# Course Description
Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist's toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

### Week 2: Linear Regression & Multivariable Regression
This week, we will work through the remainder of linear regression and then turn to the first part of multivariable regression.

### Week 3: Multivariable Regression, Residuals, & Diagnostics
This week, we'll build on last week's introduction to multivariable regression with some examples and then cover residuals, diagnostics, variance inflation, and model comparison.

### Week 4: Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression
This week, we will work on generalized linear models, including binary outcomes and Poisson regression.

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
  1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
  2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
