# Introduction
This is the fourth course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, **Exploratory Data Analysis**. This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data.

# Course Description
This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

### Week 1: Graphs, Plotting, and Graphics Devices
This week covers the basics of analytic graphics and the base plotting system in R

This assignment uses data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site. Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

### Week 2: Advanced Graphics Systems
This week covers some of the more advanced graphing systems available in R: the Lattice system and the ggplot2 system. While the base graphics system provides many important tools for visualizing data, it was part of the original R system and lacks many features that may be desirable in a plotting system, particularly when visualizing high dimensional data. The Lattice and ggplot2 systems also simplify the laying out of plots making it a much less tedious process.

### Week 3: Other Plotting Tools
This week covers some of the workhorse statistical methods for exploratory analysis. These methods include clustering and dimension reduction techniques that allow you to make graphical displays of very high dimensional data (many many variables). We also cover novel ways to specify colors in R so that you can use color as an important and useful dimension when making data graphics. All of this material is covered in chapters 9-12 of my book Exploratory Data Analysis with R.

### Week 4: Case Studies
This week, we'll look at two case studies in exploratory data analysis. The first involves the use of cluster analysis techniques, and the second is a more involved analysis of some air pollution data. How one goes about doing EDA is often personal, but I'm providing these videos to give you a sense of how you might proceed with a specific type of dataset.

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.
