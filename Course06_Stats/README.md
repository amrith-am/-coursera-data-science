# Introduction
This is the sixth course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, **Statistical Inference**. This course focuses on the fundamentals of statistical inference.

# Course Description
In this class students will learn the fundamentals of statistical inference. Students will receive a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. Students will be able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and will be able to use the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.

### Week 3: Intervals, Testing, & Pvalues
We will be taking a look at intervals, testing, and pvalues in this lesson.

### Week 4: Power, Bootstrapping, & Permutation Tests
We will begin looking into power, bootstrapping, and permutation tests.

The project consists of two parts
  1. A simulation exercise: In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

  2. Basic inferential data analysis: analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering). You will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of the series, ideally you'll use knitr to create the reports and convert to a pdf.
