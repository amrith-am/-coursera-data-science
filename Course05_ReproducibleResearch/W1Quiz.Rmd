1. Suppose I conduct a study and publish my findings. Which of the following is an example 
of a replication of my study?
  - I give my data to an independent investigator at another institution, she
analyzes the data and gets the same results as I originally obtained.
  - I take my own data, analyze it again, and publish new findings 
  - An investigator at another institution conducts a study addressing a different scientific question and publishes her findings.
  - **An investigator at another institution conducts a study addressing the same question, collects her own data, analyzes it separately from me, and publishes her own findings.**

2. Which of the following is a requirement for a published data analysis to be reproducible?
  - The data analysis is conducted using R.
  - **The investigator makes the analytic data publicly available.**
  - The analysis is conducted on a variant of the Unix operating system.
  - The investigator makes available his computer, on which the analysis was originally conducted.

3. Which of the following is an example of a reproducible study?
  - **The study's analytic data and computer code for the data analysis are publicly available. When the code is run on the analytic data, the ô€ƒ’ndings are identical to the published results.**
  - The study's analytic data are publicly available, but the computer code is not.
  - The study's original authors re-run their computer code on their analytic data and confirm publicly that the findings match those of the published results.
  - The study's analytic data and computer code are not publicly available, but the
study was simple enough to be repeated by an independent investigator.

4. Which of the following is a reason that a study might NOT be fully **replicated**?
  - **The original stdy was expensive and there is no money to repeat it in a different setting.**
  - The original study had null findings.
  - The original study was conducted by a well-known investigator.
  - The original investigator does not want to make the analytic data available.
  
5. Which of the following is a reason why publishing **reproducible research** is increasingly
important?  
  - Most studies today are small-scale and easily replicated.
  - Computing power is limited today, making it difficult to apply sophisticated statistical methods.
  - The statistical methods for most studies can be accurately described using
plain language.
  - **New technologies are increasing the rate of data collection, creating datasets that are more complex and extremely high dimensional.**

6. What is the role of processing code in the research pipeline?
  - It transforms the computational results into figures and tables.
  - It conducts the statistical analysis of the primary outcome.
  - It transforms the analytic data into computational results.
  - **It transforms the measured data into analytic data.**

7. Which is a goal of literate statistical programming?
  - **Combine explanatory text and data analysis code in a single document.**
  - Require that data analysis summaries are always written in LaTeX.
  - Ensure that data analysis documents are always exported in PDF format.
  - Separate figures and tables from other data analytic summaries.

8. What does it mean to weave a literate statistical program?
  - Transform a literate program from R to python.
  - **Transform the literate program into a human readable document.**
  - Transform the literate program into a machine readable code file.
  - Compress the literate program so that it takes up less space.
  
9. Which of the following is required to implement a literate programming system?
  - A program that views PDF files.
  - A Unix-based computer system.
  - A web server for publishing documents.
  - **A programming language like R.**

10. What is one way in which the knitr system differs from Sweave?
  - knitr is written in python instead of R.
  - knitr lacks features like caching of code chunks.
  - knitr was developed by Friedrich Leisch.
  - **knitr allows for the use of markdown instead of LaTeX.**
